This little project contains my own hashmap implementation in java
programming language. After creating the specific methods and data
structures for a hashmap I created two classes "Student" and 
"LazyStudent" with the method for hashing different. In "Student"
the function which calculates the hash is a specialized one while
in "LazyStudent" the function is always returning a constant value.
I did this to see the performance gived by a good hashmap. 
In main I added 2000 of "Student" objects and 2000 of "LazyStudent"
objects and when I tryed to access its, the difference in 
performance was much better for the objects  added with a good
function for calculating the hash number.
